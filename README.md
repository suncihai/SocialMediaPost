# web-development-socialmediapost
A social wall that users could see many posts of twitters or instagrams

First load data from a json file using ajax.getJSON(), then create DOM elements in javascript because it is not suitable to write directly
in HTML (if there are hundreds of posts...). 
Deploy a customized function to sort the posts by their published data. 
Apply column-count attribute in css file to represent the post box like pinterest.
